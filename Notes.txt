- HeartBeat sending
	Â· hb|<portnumber>|<sequencenumber>
	> Seq# (0,...) increasing 1 by 1.
	> hb is broadcast to all neighbour peers every 2 seconds.
	> If one peer couldn't set TCP connection with another peer within 2 seconds
	  it has to retry to send the hb in the next period.

- HeartBeat receiving and ServerInfo sending
	> Handle hb's as with 'tx' and 'pb' requests.
	  - Log the corresponding ServerInfo into ServerStatus with current time.
	  - If a peer has not heard from a Server for 4 seconds, remove that
	    ServerInfo from ServerSttus.
	  - If it's the first time Q hears from P, Q should also broadcast
		    si|<portQ>|<P'sIP>|<portP>	-- TO ALL NEIGHBOURS BUT P
	  - THEN each thread shouldn't try to connect with another peer for more than 2 secodnds

- ServerInfo receiving and SererInfo relaying
	> IF server S knows P from before, don't relay.
	> ELSE relay ServerInfo message to all neighbours except to the originator of the 
	  ServerInfo message and the server P {DOES P MEAN ALL KNOWN P'S}
		    si|<ports>|<P'sIP>|<portP>

1. Even if you have never heard from that server before, if what you 
receive is a heartbeat message with a sequence number that is different 
from 0, you do not broadcast anything. In that case you should only add it to serverstatus.

2. Check for expiry should be conduct only when a heartbeat is received. CHECK TUTORIAL
OF WEEK 26APRIL - 2MAY		->			QUESTION 174

3. Make sure you have: submission/src/*.java

4. The purpose of sending port number in the hb is that sending them, you can use a 
   port for receiving messages and another for sending. 

   The purpose of sending port number and IP in the si is that they are NOT YET KNOWN, NEW
   and might be relayed by a node that's not the sender. (???????)

5. In the hb command, port number is the sender's port.

6. CHECK LAST APRIL TUTORIAL. 

7. We should be listening for the heartbeats on the same port as the heartbeats are sent, 
   therefore the port is sent with the heartbeat, and is that the port answers go to?

8. SECOND ARGUMENT OF THE SI COMMAND IS THE SENDER, NOT THE ORIGINATOR, SO EVERYTIME IT'S
   RELAYED, IT MUST BE CHANGED WITH THE NEW SENDER'S DETAILS

9. WTF IS RPC? QUESTION 187

10. When you receive a hb, you add its ServerInfo and date to the hashmap. If you receive 
    an SI message about a server you haven't heard of before, you also add it to hashmap.

11. Assume messages were sanitized by the client sending the request.
